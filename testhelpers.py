# For AI placement
# Give player option to randomize as well?
# generate pairs of tuples (beg, end)
# Randomly select one of those pairs for first ship and add it to the board
# Randomly select next pair, checking that theres no overlap
# worth considering paradigms for tracking covered squares and comparing
        # check if beg and end empty first
        # if so use generate full funct and check those? O(1) to check any coordinate, and generate full is at most O(5)
        # hash map might better if board was theoretically infinite but these are hard limits for now
        # if the board is made dynamically resizable in future iteration and larger ships added there still won't be any lengths over 10 so "O(n)" means far less here
