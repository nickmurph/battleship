# Battleship 
Battleship is a fully functional command-line implementation of the classic board game. The user places their ships on a 10x10 grid and then must carefully select firing positions on an opponent's obscured 10x10 grid, hoping to hit all of the enemy's ships before their own are likewise located and destroyed.
